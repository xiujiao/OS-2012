      Neo: no one has ever done anything like this.
      <div style="text-align:right;"> <strong>&mdash;Trinity</strong> </div>
      That's why it's going to work.
      <div style="text-align:right;"> <strong>&mdash;Neo</strong> </div> </a> </div> <h1>ASST3: Virtual Memory</h1> <div style="clear: both;"></div> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p> You have improved OS/161 to the point that you can now run user
    processes. However, there are a number of shortcomings in the current
    system. A process's size is limited by the number of TLB entries (i.e.,
    64 pages). In addition, while <kbd>kmalloc()</kbd> correctly manages
    sub-page allocations (i.e. memory requests for under <kbd>4KB</kbd>),
    single and multiple-page requests are not properly returned to the
    system, meaning that address space pages are discarded after use,
    severely limiting the lifetime of your system.</p> <p> In this assignment we will adapt OS/161 to take full advantage of the
    simulated hardware by implementing management of the MIPS
    software-managed Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). You will write the
    code to manage this TLB. You will also write the code to implement paging
    &mdash;the mechanism by which memory pages of an active process can be
    sent to disk when memory is needed, and restored to memory when required
    by the program. This permits many processes to share limited physical
    memory while providing each process with the abstraction of a very large
    virtual memory. Finally, you will correctly handle page reclamation,
    allowing your system to reclaim memory when processes exit and (in
    theory, at least) run forever.</p> <p> ASST3 is the culmination of this class. It is harder than ASST2 in many
    ways. In particular, for ASST2 you were essentially connecting two
    interfaces: the system call interface and the virtual filesystem (VFS)
    interface. There were some new features to implement&mdash;like
    filetables and process relationship tracking&mdash;but ASST3 is
    <em>all</em> new features to implement, and includes multiple large code
    modules that must interface cleanly with each other.</p> <p>The advice from ASST2 is worth reiterating now that you've learned the
    cost of ignoring it:</p> <blockquote><p>As a final piece of advice, ASST2 and ASST3 begin to produce code
      bases that are large, complex, and potentially <i>very</i> difficult to
      debug. <em>You do not want to introduce bugs into your kernel.</em>
      Fine, you might say: how do I do that? Our advice&mdash;slow down,
      design, think, design again, discuss with your partner, and slow down
      again all <em>before</em> writing a <i>single line</i> of
      code.</p></blockquote> <p>Were you frustrated by ASST2? <em>This is your chance to get
      even.</em></p> <p>The description of ASST3 is somewhat shorter than it was for ASST2. This
    should make you feel nervous. In fact, there is less to introduce you to
    simply because there is more to do. That said, we <em>strongly</em>
    suggest you look carefully at the <kbd>dumbvm</kbd> included in your
    source tree and included in your build for assignments 0&ndash;2. It can
    at least give you an idea of where to start.</p> <p>The following instructions detail precisely what you must do for ASST3.
    Sections marked <span class="handmein">like this</span> include graded
    tasks that you must complete.</p> <h3>Objectives</h3> <p>After completing ASST0 you should:</p> <ul> <li>Understand how to design a set of interfaces to implement a
      collection of functionality.</li> <li>Be familiar with OS handling of TLB and page faults.</li> <li>Possess a solid intuition about virtual memory and what it means to
      support it.</li> <li>Have completed this class!</li> </ul> <h2>TLB Handling and Paging</h2> <p> In the System/161 machine, each TLB entry includes a 20-bit virtual
    page number and a  20-bit physical page number as well as the following
    five fields:</p> <ul> <li> <kbd>global</kbd>: 1 bit; if set, ignore the <kbd>pid</kbd> bits in the TLB. </li> <li> <kbd>valid</kbd>: 1 bit; set if the TLB entry contains a valid translation.</li> <li> <kbd>dirty</kbd>: 1 bit; enables writing to the page referenced by the
      entry; if this bit is 0, the page is only accessible for reading.</li> <li> <kbd>nocache</kbd>: 1 bit; unused in System/161. In a real processor,
      indicates that the hardware cache will be disabled when accessing this page.</li> <li> <kbd>pid</kbd>: 6 bits; a context or address space ID that can be used
      to allow entries to remain in the TLB after a context switch.</li> </ul> <p> All these bits/values are maintained by the operating system. When the
    <kbd>valid</kbd> bit is set, the TLB entry contains a valid translation.
    This implies that the virtual page is present in physical memory. A
    <em>TLB miss</em> occurs when no TLB entry can be found with a matching
    virtual page and address space ID (unless the global bit is set in which
    case the address space ID is ignored) with the valid bit set.</p> <h3>TLB and Page Faults</h3> <p> The operating system creates the illusion of unlimited memory by using
    physical memory as a cache of <em>virtual pages</em>. Paging relaxes the
    requirement that all the pages in a process's virtual address space must
    be in physical memory. Instead, we allow a process to have pages either
    on disk or in memory. When the process issues an access to a page  that
    is on disk, a <em>page fault</em> occurs. The operating system must
    retrieve the page from disk and bring it into memory. Pages with valid
    TLB entries are always in physical memory. This means that a reference to
    a page on disk will always generate a TLB fault.  At the time of a TLB
    fault, the hardware generates a TLB exception, trapping to the operating
    system. The operating system then checks its own page table to locate the
    virtual page requested. If that page is currently in memory but wasn't
    mapped by the TLB, then all we need to do is update the TLB. However, the
    page might be on disk.  If this is the case, the operating system
    must:</p> <ol> <li> Allocate a place in physical memory to store the page;</li> <li> Read the page from disk,</li> <li> Update the page table entry with the new virtual-to-physical
      address translation;</li> <li> Update the TLB to contain the new translation; and</li> <li> Resume execution of the user program.</li> </ol> <p> Notice that when the operating system selects a location in physical
    memory in which to place the new page, the space may already be occupied.
    In this case, the operating  system must <em>evict</em> that other page
    from memory. If the page has been modified or does not currently have a
    copy on disk, then the old page must first be written to disk before the
    physical page can be reallocated. If the old page has not been modified
    and already has a copy on disk, then the write to disk can be avoided.
    The appropriate page table entry must be updated to reflect the fact that
    the page is no longer in memory.</p> <p> As with any caching system, performance of your virtual memory system
    depends on the policy used to decide which things are kept in memory and
    which are evicted. On a page fault, the kernel must decide which page to
    replace. Ideally, it will evict a page that will not be needed soon. Many
    systems (such as UNIX) avoid the delay of synchronously
    writing memory pages to disk on a page fault by writing modified pages to
    disk in advance, so that subsequent page faults can be completed more
    quickly.</p> <h3 class="handmein">Questions</h3> <p>These should help refresh your memory a bit on the details of address
    translation and the types of memory-related faults.</p> <blockquote class="warning"> <p>Please <a href="../accounts/login?next=%252FASST%252F3">log in</a> so that you can submit your answers.

    a <em>standard job interview question</em>&mdash;you should understand
    this code!</p> <h2>Implementation</h2> <p>Your mission on ASST3 is to:</p> <ul> <li>Implement the code that services TLB faults.</li> <li>Add paging to your operating system.</li> <li>Add the <kbd>sbrk()</kbd> system call, so that the
      <kbd>malloc()</kbd> we give you works.</li> </ul> <h3>Setup</h3> <p>Consult the ASST3 config file and notice that the
    <kbd>arch/mips/mips/dumbvm.c</kbd> file will be omitted from your kernel.
    You will undoubtedly need to add new files to the system for this
    assignment, e.g., <kbd>kern/vm/vm.c</kbd> or
    <kbd>kern/arch/mips/mips/mipsvm.c</kbd>. Be sure to  update
    the file <kbd>kern/conf/conf.kern</kbd>, or, for machine-dependent files,
    <kbd>kern/arch/mips/conf/conf.arch</kbd>, to include any new files that
    you create. Take care to place files in the "correct" place, separating
    machine-dependent components from  machine-independent components.</p> <p> You should also now restrict your physical memory to 512 KB by editing
    the <tt>ramsize</tt> line in your <tt>sys161.conf</tt> file.</p> <p> Now, config an ASST3 kernel, run <tt>make depend</tt>, and build it.
    You are now ready to begin the assignment.</p> <h3>TLB Handling</h3> <p> In this part of the assignment, you will modify OS/161 to handle TLB
    faults. Additionally, you need to guarantee that the TLB state is
    initialized properly on a context switch. One implementation alternative
    is to invalidate all the TLB entries on a context switch. The entries are
    then re-loaded by taking TLB faults as pages are referenced. If
    you do this,  be sure to copy any relevant state maintained by the TLB
    entries back into the page table before invalidating them. (For example,
    in order for the paging algorithm to know which pages must be written to
    disk before eviction, you must make sure that the information about
    whether a page is dirty or not is properly propagated back into the page
    table.) An alternative to invalidating everything is to use the 6-bit
    address space IDs and maintain separate processes in the TLB
    simultaneously. Please separate implementation of the TLB entry
    replacement algorithm from the actual piece of code that handles the
    replacement.</p> <h3>Paging</h3> <p> In this part of the assignment, you will modify OS/161 to handle page
    faults. When you have completed this problem, your system will generate
    an exception when a process tries to access an address that is not
    memory-resident and then handle that exception and continue running the
    user process.</p> <p> You will need routines to move a page from disk to memory and from
    memory to disk.</p> <p> You will need to decide how to implement backing store (the place on
    disk where you store virtual pages not currently stored in physical
    memory). The default <kbd>sys161.conf</kbd> includes two disks; you can
    use one of those disks for swapping. Please do swap to a disk and not
    somewhere else (such as a file). Also, be sure not to use that disk
    for anything else! To help prevent errors or misunderstandings, please
    have your system print the location of the swap space when it boots.</p> <p> You will need to store evicted pages and find them when you need them.
    You should maintain a bitmap that describes the space in your swap area.
    Think of the swap area as a collection of chunks, where each chunk holds
    a page. Use the bitmap to keep track of which chunks are full and which
    are empty. The empty chunks can be evicted into. You also need to keep
    track, for each page of a given address space, of which chunk in the swap
    area it maps onto. When there are too many pages to fit in physical
    memory, you can write (modified) pages out to swap.</p> <p>When the time comes to bring a page into memory, you will need to know
    which physical pages are currently in use. One way to manage physical
    memory is to maintain a <em>core map</em>, a sort of reverse page table.
    Instead of being indexed by virtual addresses, a core map is indexed by
    its physical page number and contains the virtual address and address
    space identifier for the virtual page currently backed by the page in
    physical memory. When you need to evict a page, you look up the physical
    address in the core map, locate the address space whose page you are
    evicting and modify the corresponding state information to indicate that
    the page will no longer be in memory. Then you can evict the page. If the
    page is dirty, it must first be written to the backing store. In some
    systems, the writing of dirty pages to backing  store is done in the
    background by a daemon. As a result, when the time comes to evict a page,
    the page itself usually clean (that is, it has been written to backing
    store, but not modified since then). You must design and implement this
    functionality in your system. You will need to create a thread that
    periodically examines pages in memory and writes them to backing store if
    they are dirty.</p> <p> Your paging system will also need to support page allocation requests
    generated by <kbd>kmalloc()</kbd>. You should review <kbd>kmalloc()</kbd>
    to understand how these requests are generated, so that your system will
    respond to them correctly.</p> <p>Please implement one page replacement policy for ASST3.</p> <h2>Assignment Submission</h2> <p>Use the forms below to submit your design document and implementation
