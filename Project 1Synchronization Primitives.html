      <div style="text-align:right;"> <strong>&mdash;Morpheus</strong> </div> </a> </div> <h1>ASST1: Implementing and Using Synchronization Primitives</h1> <div style="clear: both;"></div> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>In this assignment you will implement synchronization primitives for
    OS/161 and use them to solve several synchronization problems. Once you
    have ASST1 you should have a fairly solid grasp of the pitfalls of
    concurrent programming and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;how to avoid
    those pitfalls in the code you write during the rest of the semester.</p> <p>To complete this assignment you will need to be familiar with the
    OS/161 thread code. The thread system provides interrupts, control
    functions, and semaphores. You will implement locks, condition variables,
    and reader/writer locks.</p> <p>The following instructions detail what you must do to complete ASST1.
    Sections marked <span class="handmein">like this</span> include graded
    tasks to complete.</p> <h3>Objectives</h3> <p>After completing ASST1 you should:</p> <ol> <li>Understand how OS/161 implements semaphores.
    <li>Be comfortable implementing synchronization primitives.
    <li>Be able to select an appropriate synchronization primitive for a
    given problem.
    <li>Be able to properly synchronize different types of problems.
  </ol> <h2>Writing Readable and Maintainable Code</h2> <p>In your programming assignments, you are expected to write
    well-documented, readable code. Generally this is good practice;
    specifically, during this semester:</p> <ul> <li>you will be working in pairs on ASST2 and ASST3,
      and it will be important for you to be able to read <em>your
        partner's</em> code,</li> <li>you will be continuing to work on your OS/161 codebase,
      and it will be important for you to be able to read <em>your own</em>
      code, and</li> <li>when asking for help from the course staff, it will make it
      easier for us to understand what you have done, what you have failed to
      do, and why.</li> </ul> <p>There is no single right way to organize and document your code. It is
  not our intent to dictate a particular coding style for this class. The
  best way to learn about writing readable code is to read other people's
  code. Read the OS/161 code, read your partner's code, read the source
  code of some freely available operating system. When you read someone
  else's code, note what you like and what you don't like. Pay close
  attention to the lines of comments which most clearly and efficiently
  explain what is going on. When you write code yourself, keep these
  observations in mind.</p> <p>Here are some general tips for writing better code:</p> <ul> <li><em>Group related items together</em>, whether they are variable declarations, 
  lines of code, or functions.</li> <li><em>Use descriptive names</em> for variables and procedures. Be consistent
  with this throughout the program.</li> <li>Comments should describe <em>the programmer's intent</em>, not the
  actual mechanics of the code. A comment which says "Find a free disk
  block" is much more informative than one that says "Find first non-zero
  element of array." The first adds information to what is present in code itself, the
  second does not.</li> </ul> <p>When you begin ASST2, you and your partner will probably find it
  useful to agree on a coding style. For instance, you might want to agree
  on how variables and functions will be
  named&mdash;<kbd>my_function</kbd>, <kbd>myFunction</kbd>,
  <kbd>MyFunction</kbd>, <kbd>mYfUnCtIoN</kbd>,
  <kbd>ymayUnctionFay</kbd>&mdash;since your code will have to
  interoperate.</p> <h2>Git-ing Started</h2> <p>You knew we would come back to Git, right? Git-ting started on ASST1
  requires that you do two new tasks with Git: tag your repository, for
  convenience; and use Git to download some updates to the OS/161 source tree
  that we have made and you will need to complete this assignment.</p> <h3>Git-ting Taggy With It</h3> <p>You'll remember from last time that Git stores a series of snapshots of
  your working tree in its repository each time you perform a commit. It
  labels these commits with a 40-character unique identifier, like
  <kbd>9d5a8350e71705a4e4356f3680a36d2961aaf9d7</kbd>, although we can
  usually use a shortened version like
  <kbd>9d5a8350</kbd> as long as it uniquely identifies a commit.</p> <p>Here's the rub though: these commit identifiers work fine for Git, but
  they don't work so well for humans. Let's say I asked you to generate a
  patch (using <kbd>git diff</kbd>) containing all of the changes that you
  made for ASST0. How would you do it? Given the tools we've given you up to
  now, unless you are good at remembering arbitrary 40-character strings, you
  would do the following:</p> <ol> <li>Use <kbd>git log</kbd> to inspect the commit logs.</li> <li>Try to remember that the last commit that was entered before you
    began ASST0 was entered by me, Geoffrey Challen, and included the comment
    "Fix build failure in psort.c"</li> <li>Cut and paste the commit ID <kbd>8c0b79c9</kbd>.</li> <li>Run <kbd>git diff 8c0b79c9</kbd> and examine the result.</li> </ol> <p>We can do better. Git can do better! Git supports tags. Let's add a tag
  to our tree identifying the commit we found above to help us remember next
  time:</p> <pre class="code">
cse421@zion:~/src$ git tag -a "asst0-start" -m "ASST0 start." 8c0b79c9</pre> <p>Easy peasy. Git can also show you tags that are available in your
  repository:</p> <pre class="code">
cse421@zion:~/src$ git tag
asst0-start</pre> <p>And, of course, allow you to <kbd>git diff</kbd> against tags you've
  created:</p> <pre class="code">
cse421@zion:~/src$ git diff asst0-start</pre> <p>Git tags come in handy when creating diffs, which we may ask you to do
  later in the semester. For example, we might ask to see the changes that
  you made for ASST0&mdash;<kbd>git diff asst0-start asst0-end</kbd>&mdash;or
  all the changes between several assignments&mdash;<kbd>git diff asst0-start
  asst2-end</kbd>. So please start tagging your tree at the start of each
  assignment. Do it. Do it now. First, use <kbd>git status</kbd> to check the
  condition of your working tree. Assuming you're clean, run <kbd>git tag -a
  "asst1-start"</kbd>. (Without a commit ID, what do you think that <kbd>git
  tag</kbd> does? Right. The obvious thing.)</p> <h3>Remotely Gitorious</h3> <p>You may have been wondering: Git seems great, but given that all my
  changes are stored locally, how do I collaborate?</p> <p>Good question! And Git has a good answer: <em>remote repositories</em>
  or <em>remotes</em>. Remote repositories create rendezvous points allowing
  two, more, or even a single user on multiple machines to share their local
  changes. To do so, Git users <em>push</em> or transmit their changes to
  remote repositories and <em>pull</em> or receive changes from others.</p> <p>In fact, you already know a bit about remote repositories. When you
  downloaded the OS/161 source code using <kbd>git clone</kbd> in ASST0 you
  used a remote repository located at
  <kbd>git://git.cse421.net/src/os161</kbd>. When you clone a repository, Git
  automatically sets up the remote repository you cloned from as linked to
  your clone. You can see evidence of this if you run:</p> <pre class="code">
cse421@zion:~/src$ git remote -v
origin  git://git.cse421.net/src/os161 (fetch)
origin  git://git.cse421.net/src/os161 (push)</pre> <p>This output indicates that your repository is set to push and pull
  changes from a remote repository with URL
  <kbd>git://git.cse421.net/src/os161</kbd> and called <kbd>origin</kbd>.
  Luckily for us, however, you don't have the permissions to push to this
  repository which is shared by the entire class; it's under the control of
  the course staff. You can, however, pull changes from it, which we are
  about to do.</p> <h3>ASST1 Changes</h3> <p>We have made a number of changes to your base OS/161 source tree to support
  ASST1. We do not think that these changes will overlap with ones that you
  made for ASST0, but if they do it is your job to reconcile any merge
  conflicts that occur later.</p> <p>As a brief summary of the changes we made:</p> <ul> <li><kbd>kern/synchprobs/drivers.c</kbd>: driver code for the ASST1
    synchronization probems.</li> <li><kbd>kern/synchprobs/problems.c</kbd>: stub solution code for the
    ASST1 synchronization problems.</li> <li><kbd>kern/synchprobs/whalemating.c</kbd>: removed; code moved into the
    files above.</li> <li><kbd>kern/include/test.h</kbd>: added primitives necessary for the
    synchronization problems and drivers.</li> <li><kbd>kern/conf/conf.kern</kbd>: modified to include
    <kbd>kern/synchprobs/drivers.c</kbd> and
    <kbd>kern/synchprobs/problems.c</kbd> instead of
    <kbd>kern/syncprobs/whalemating.c</kbd> when configuring for ASST1.</li> <li><kbd>kern/startup/main.c</kbd>: adding menu items to launch each of
    the synchronization problem drivers.</li> </ul> <h3>Git-ting Our Changes</h3> <p>While these changes are available as commit <kbd>cc722f8b6</kbd> in the
  remote repository located at <kbd>git://git.cse421.net/src/os161</kbd>, you
  have probably not received them yet. To do so, you need to tell Git to
  fetch the changes we have made and merge them into your repository.
  <em>Before you perform any merge it is best to have any changes in your
  working directory committed.</em> Run <kbd>git status</kbd> and make sure
  that it reports a clean working directory. Then, do the pull:</p> <pre class="code">
cse421@zion:~/src$ git pull</pre> <blockquote class="aside"><p>you may wonder: how did Git know what remote
  repository to pull from given the command above? By default Git is
  configured to automatically pull changes from the <em>origin</em> remote
  repository. You can, of course, change this.</p></blockquote> <p>Assuming everything goes according to plan, you will have our changes.
  If the changes we made conflicted with changes that you made for ASST0, Git
  will complain and ask you to fix the conficts and explicitly commit the
  result. If the merge completely cleanly, however, you should not need to
  commit anything.</p> <p>After completing the pull, look around to make sure that the changes
  have been made. Look in <kbd>kern/synchprobs</kbd> and make sure that you
  see <kbd>problems.c</kbd> and <kbd>drivers.c</kbd> but not
  <kbd>whalemating.c</kbd>. Configure, build and run a a kernel for ASST1 as
  instructed below and make sure that you see the <kbd>sp1</kbd> and
  <kbd>sp2</kbd> options under the testing submenu. If you are having trouble
  getting our changes, stop and contact the course staff before going on.</p> <h2>ASST1 Setup</h2> <p>We have provided a framework allowing you to develop and test your
    solutions for the ASST1 synchronization problems described below. This
    framework consists of:</p> <ul> <li><kbd>kern/synchprobs/problems.c</kbd>: this is the file where you
      will implement your solutions to the ASST1 synchronization problems.</li> <li><kbd>kern/synchprobs/drivers.c</kbd>: this file contains driver code
    we will use to test your solutions. You can and should change this file
    to stress test your code, but there should be no dependencies between
    your synchronization problem solutions and the problem drivers. <em>We
    will replace the contents of this file during testing.</em></li> </ul> <p>In order to include this files in your kernel you will need to configure
    it for ASST1. This is very similar to what we did for ASST0, almost so
    similar that we wonder why we're reminding you, but why not:</p> <pre class="code">cse421@zion:~/src/$ cd kern/conf/
cse421@zion:~/src/kern/conf$ ./config ASST1
cse421@zion:~/src/kern/conf$ cd ../compile/ASST1
cse421@zion:~/src/kern/compile/ASST1$ bmake depend
cse421@zion:~/src/kern/compile/ASST1$ bmake
cse421@zion:~/src/kern/compile/ASST1$ bmake install</pre> <p>Run your kernel and you should notice several new options under the
    tests menu. These also function as command line options to run the
    synchronization problem drivers to your kernel menu. <em>Please do not
      change these menu options.</em> Doing so will interfere with our
    automated testing harness.</p> <blockquote class="aside"><p>and why, oh why, would you want to do
      that?</p></blockquote> <p>Note that you can pass arguments to your kernel from the command line. A
    quoted semicolon-delimited set of arguments will behave as if you had
    typed each sequentially at the kernel menu. Try the following:</p> <pre class="code">cse421@zion:~/root/$ sys161 kernel "tt1;q"</pre> <p>Finally, in order to complete the tests for this assignment you will
    need to boot your kernel with more than the 512K of memory System/161
    boots with by default. We suggest configuring System/161 to use at least
    2MB or more memory by making the appropriate adjustment to
    <kbd>sys161.conf</kbd>. We'll leave figuring out how to do that to
    you.</p> <h2>Concurrency in OS/161</h2> <p>The goal of synchronization is to eliminate any undesirable timing
    effects&mdash;or <em>race conditions</em>&mdash;on the output of your
    programs. For the synchronization problems we provide, threads <i>may</i>
    run in different orders depending on the order of events, but by using
    the synchronization primitives you will build, you should be able to
    guarantee that they meet the constraints inherent to each problem while
    not deadlocking.</p> <h3>Built-in Thread Tests</h3> <p>When you booted OS/161 in ASST0, you may have seen the options to run
    the thread tests. The thread test code uses the semaphore synchronization
    primitive. You should trace the execution of one of these thread tests in
    GDB to see how the scheduler acts, how threads are created, and what
    exactly happens in a context switch. You should be able to step through
    a call to <kbd>thread_switch()</kbd> and see exactly where the current
    thread changes.</p> <p>Thread test 1&mdash;or <kbd>tt1</kbd> at the kernel menu or on the
    command line&mdash;prints the numbers 0 through 7 each time each thread
    loops. Thread test 2 (<kbd>tt2</kbd>) prints only when each thread starts
    and exits.  The latter is intended to show that the scheduler doesn't
    cause starvation -- the threads should all start together, spin for
    awhile, and then end together.</p> <h3>Debugging Concurrent Programs</h3> <p>One of the frustrations of debugging concurrent programs is that timing
    effects will cause them them to do something different each time. The end
    result should not be different&mdash;that would be a race condition. But
    the ordering of threads and how they are scheduled may change. For the
    purposes of testing you may want to create more determinism.</p> <p>You will notice in <kbd>kern/thread/thread.c</kbd> in
    <kbd>thread_startup</kbd> that when <kbd>OPT_SYNCHPROBS</kbd> is defined
    threads will call <kbd>thread_yield</kbd> a random number of times during
    startup, producing an immediate context switch each time. This is designed
    to get a good mix of threads when running the thread tests and your
    synchronization problem solutions. If we did not do this, it is likely that
    threads would run first-in-first-out (FIFO) given the scheduling
    quantum, which would not be very interesting!</p> <p>The random number generator used to vary the time between these
    <kbd>thread_yield()</kbd> calls uses the same seed as the random device in
    System/161. This means that you can reproduce a specific execution sequence
    by using a fixed seed for the random number generator. You can pass an
    explicit seed into random device by editing the "random" line in your
    <kbd>sys161.conf</kbd> file.  For example, to set the seed to 1 , you would
    edit the line to look like:</p> <pre class=code>28 random seed=1</pre> <p>We recommend that while you are writing and debugging your solutions you
    pick a seed and use it consistently. Once you are confident that your
    threads do what they are supposed to do, set the random device to
    <kbd>autoseed</kbd>. This should allow you to test your solutions under
    varying conditions and may expose scenarios that you had not
    anticipated.</p> <blockquote class="aside"><p>when you start using the simulated disk for
      ASST3, it has its own random delay meaning that even if you use the
      same seed you may not get reproducible results. Life's tough,
      right?</p></blockquote> <h3 class="handmein">ASST1 Code Reading</h3> <blockquote class="warning"> <p>Please <a href="../accounts/login?next=%252FASST%252F1">log in</a> so that you can submit your answers.
    </p> </blockquote> <p>To implement synchronization primitives, you will have to understand the
    operation of the threading system in OS/161. It may also help you to look
    at the provided implementation of semaphores. When you are writing
    solution code for the synchronization problems it will help if you also
    understand exactly what the OS/161 scheduler does when it dispatches
    among threads.</p> <p>Please answer the following questions using the form below.</p> <h4>Thread Questions</h4> <div class="question codereading"> <a class="anchor" name="Q0"> <div class="text"> What happens to a thread when it calls <kbd>thread_exit()</kbd>?

The moment you've been
    waiting for!</p> <p>It is possible to implement the primitives below on top of other
    primitives. It is, however, not always a great idea. You should
    definitely read and understanding the existing semaphore implementation
    since that can be used as a model for several of the other primitives we
    ask you to implement below.</p> <h3 class="handmein">Implement Locks</h3> <p>Implement locks for OS/161. The interface for the lock structure is defined
    in <kbd>kern/include/synch.h</kbd>. Stub code is provided in
    <kbd>kern/threads/synch.c</kbd>.</p> <p>When you are done you should repeatedly pass the <kbd>sy2</kbd> lock
    test provided by OS/161.</p> <p>Note that you will not be able to run any of these tests an unlimited
    number of times. Due to limitations in the current virtual memory system
    used by your kernel, appropriately called <kbd>dumbvm</kbd>, your kernel
    is leaking a lot of memory. However, your synchronization primitives
    themselves <em>should not leak memory</em>, and you can inspect the
    kernel heap stats to ensure that they do not. (We will.)</p> <blockquote class="aside"><p>you may wonder why, if the kernel is leaking
      memory, the kernel heap stats don't change between runs of
      <kbd>sy1</kbd>, for example, indicating that the semaphore
      implementation allocates and frees memory properly. The reason is that
      the kernel <kbd>malloc()</kbd> implementation we have provided is
      <em>not</em> broken, and it will correctly allocate, free and
      reallocate small items inside of the memory made available to it by the
      kernel. What does leak are larger allocations like, for example, the 4K
      thread kernel stacks, and it is these large items that eventually cause
      the kernel to run out of memory and <kbd>panic()</kbd>. Look at
      <kbd>kern/arch/mips/vm/dumbvm.c</kbd> for more details about what's
      broken and why.</p></blockquote> <h3 class="handmein">Implement Condition Variables</h3> <p>Implement condition variables with Mesa&mdash;or
    non-blocking&mdash;semantics for OS/161. The interface for the condition
    variable structure is also defined in <kbd>synch.h</kbd> and stub code is
    provided in <kbd>synch.c</kbd>.</p> <p>We have not discussed the differences between condition variable
    semantics. Two different varieties exist: Hoare, or blocking, and Mesa,
    or non-blocking. The difference is in how <kbd>cv_signal</kbd> is
    handled:</p> <ul> <li>In <em>Hoare</em> semantics, the thread that calls
      <kbd>cv_signal</kbd> will block until the signaled thread (if any) runs
      and releases the lock.</li> <li>In <em>Mesa</em> semantics the thread that calls <kbd>cv_signal</kbd>
      will awaken one thread waiting on the condition variable but will not
      block.</li> </ul> <p>Please implement Mesa semantics. When you are done you should repeatedly
    pass the <kbd>sy3</kbd> condition variable test provided by OS/161.</p> <h3 class="handmein">Implement Reader-Writer Locks</h3> <p>Implement reader-writer locks for OS/161. A reader-writer lock is a lock
    that threads can acquire in one of two ways: read mode or write mode.
    Read mode does not conflict with read mode, but read mode conflicts with
    write mode and write mode conflicts with write mode. The result is that
    many threads can acquire the lock in read mode, <strong>or</strong> one
    thread can acquire the lock in write mode. Your solution must also ensure
    that no thread waits to acquire the lock indefinitely, called
    <em>starvation</em>.</p> <p>Unlike regular locks and condition variables, we have not provided you
    with an interface, stub code, or iron-clad semantics for reader-writer
    locks. You must develop your own. Your implementation must solve many
    readers, one writer problem and ensure that no writers are starved even
    in the presence of many readers. Build something you will
    be comfortable using later.</p> <p>Implement your interface in <kbd>synch.h</kbd> and your code in
    <kbd>synch.c</kbd>. <em>Please use the following self-explanatory
    templates for your code to ensure that we can run it from our test
    driver.</em></p> <pre class="code">
struct rwlock * rwlock_create(const char *);
void rwlock_destroy(struct rwlock *);

void rwlock_acquire_read(struct rwlock *);
void rwlock_release_read(struct rwlock *);
void rwlock_acquire_write(struct rwlock *);
void rwlock_release_write(struct rwlock *);</pre> <p>Unlike locks and condition variables, where we have provided you with a
    test suite, we are leaving it to you to develop a test that exercises
    your reader-writer locks. You will want to edit
    <kbd>kern/startup/menu.c</kbd> to allow yourself to run the command from
    the kernel menu or command line. We have our own reader-writer test that
    we will use to test and grade your implementation.</p> <blockquote class="aside"><p>does this depart from our stated practice of
      providing you with the tools necessary to evaluate your assignment?
      Yes. And for a very good reason: writing tests is a <em>critical
        development practice</em>. You will write a lot of OS/161 code this
      semester, and particularly for ASST2 and ASST3 our tests are designed
      to tell if everything is working at a very high level. They are
      <i>comprehensive tests</i>, not <i>unit</i> tests, which target a
      particular piece of functionality. Writing good unit tests is extremely
      important to building large pieces of software&mdash;some even claim
      that you should write the unit test <em>first</em> and then the
      implementation that passes it. So we are using this opportunity to
      force you to write a unit test in the hopes that you will continue this
      practice later.</p></blockquote> <h2>Solving Synchronization Problems</h2> <p>The following problems will give you the opportunity to write some
    fairly straightforward concurrent programs and get a more detailed
    understanding of how to use threads to solve problems. We have provided
    you with basic driver code in <kbd>kern/synchprobs/drivers.c</kbd> that starts a
    predefined number of threads which call functions in
    <kbd>kern/synchprobs/problems.c</kbd>. You are responsible for implementing
    those functions which determine what those threads do. You can&mdash;and
    should&mdash;make changes to the code in <kbd>drivers.c</kbd>, but note
    that this file will be replaced by the drivers we cook up for
    testing.</p> <p>When you configure your kernel for ASST1, the driver code and extra menu
    options for executing your solutions are automatically compiled in. Type
    <kbd>?</kbd> at the menu to get a list of commands. Remember to specify a
    seed to use in the random number generator by editing your
    <kbd>sys161.conf</kbd> file. It is much easier to debug initial 
    problems when the sequence of execution and context switches is
    reproducible.</p> <p>There are two synchronization problems posed for you. You can solve
    these problems using any mixture of semaphores, locks, condition
    variables, and reader-writer locks. However, one way may be more
    straightforward than another and so you should put some thought into
    choosing the correct primitives.</p> <h3 class="handmein">The Classic CS161 Whale Mating Problem</h3> <blockquote class="aside"><p>eventually there will be "classic" CSE421
      synchronization problems, but for this year we're giving credit where
      credit is due.</p></blockquote> <p>You have been hired by the New England Aquarium's research division to
    help find a way to increase the whale population. Because there are not
    enough of them, the whales are having synchronization problems in finding a
    mate. The trick is that in order to have children, three whales are needed;
    one male, one female, and one to play matchmaker&mdash;literally, to push the
    other two whales together.</p> <p>Your job is to write the three procedures <kbd>male()</kbd>, <kbd>female()</kbd>,
    and <kbd>matchmaker()</kbd>. Each whale is represented by a separate thread.
    A male whale calls <kbd>male()</kbd>, which waits until there is a
    waiting female and matchmaker; similarly, a female whale must wait until a male
    whale and matchmaker are present. Once all three are present, the magic
    happens and then all three return.</p> <p>Each whale thread should call the appropriate <kbd>_start()</kbd>
    function when it begins mating or matchmaking and the appropriate
    <kbd>_end()</kbd> function when mating or matchmaking completes. These
    functions are part of the problem driver in <kbd>drivers.c</kbd> and you
    are welcome to change them, but we will use our own versions for testing.</p> <p>The test driver in <kbd>drivers.c</kbd> forks thirty threads, and has
    ten of them invoke <kbd>male()</kbd>, ten of them invoke
    <kbd>female()</kbd>, and ten of them invoke <kbd>matchmaker()</kbd>. Stub
    routines, which do nothing but call the appropriate <kbd>_start()</kbd>
    and <kbd>_end()</kbd> functions, are provided for these three
    functions. Your job will be to re-implement these functions so that they
    solve the synchronization problem described above.</p> <p>When you are finished, you should be able to examine the output from
    running <kbd>sp1</kbd> and convince yourself that your solution satisfies
    the constraints outlined above.</p> <h3 class="handmein">The Buffalo Intersection Problem</h3> <p>If you drive in Buffalo you know two things very well:</p> <ul> <li>Four-way stops are very common.</li> <li>Knowledge of how to correctly proceed through a four-way stop is very
      uncommon.</li> </ul> <p>In general, four-way stops are so tricky that they've even been known to
    flummox the otherwise unflummoxable Google self-driving car, which both
    knows and is programmed to follow the rules.</p> <p>Given that robot cars are the future anyway, we can rethink the entire
    idea of a four-way stop. Let's model the intersection as shown below. We
    consider the intersection as composed of four <em>quadrants</em>,
    numbered 0&ndash;3. Cars approach the intersection from one of four
    <em>directions</em>, also numbered 0&ndash;3. Note that we have numbered
    the quadrants so that a car approaching from direction X enters the
    intersection in quadrant X.</p> <div style="width:480px;height:480px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"> <div style="width:159px;height:159px;float:left;border-right:1px solid black;border-bottom:1px solid black;"></div> <div style="width:160px;height:160px;float:left;text-align:left;font-size:40px;font-weight:bolder;"> <div style="width:78px; height:160px;float:left;text-align:center;border-right:2px dashed black"> <div style="padding-top:40px;">0<br />&darr;</div> </div> </div> <div style="width:159px;height:159px;float:left;border-left:1px solid black;border-bottom:1px solid black;"></div> <div style="width:160px;height:160px;float:left; font-size:40px; font-weight:bolder"> <div style="width:160px; height:80px;"></div> <div style="width:160px; height:78px;border-top:2px dashed black"> <div style="padding-top:20px; padding-left:40px;">3 &rarr;</div> </div> </div> <div style="width:160px;height:160px;float:left;"> <div style="width:78px;height:80px;border-right:2px dashed black;float:left;"> <div style="text-align:center;line-height:80px;font-size:40px;font-weight:bolder">

    primitives to implement a solution meeting the following two
    requirements:</p> <ol> <li>No two cars may be in the same quadrant of the intersection at the
      same time. This constitutes a crash.</li> <li>Once a car enters any intersection quadrant it must always be in some
      quadrant until it calls <kbd>leaveIntersection()</kbd>.</li> <li>Cars do not move diagonally between intersection quadrants.</li> <li>Your solution should improve traffic flow compared to a conventional
    four-way stop while not starving traffic from any direction.</li> </ol> <p>Before you begin coding, answer the following questions using the form

    will use to coordinate your activities for ASST2 and ASST3, you need to
    create an RSA key pair and share the public portion of that key pair with
    us. We'll have more details about collaborating using Git on the ASST2
    writeup, but here's what we need you to do now:</p> <pre class="code">
cse421@zion:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre> <p>Follow the prompts. You may or may not choose to use a passphrase with
    your SSH RSA keypair. When you are finished&mdash;assuming you chose the
    default location&mdash;you should have an <kbd>~/.ssh/</kbd> directory
    containing <kbd>id_rsa</kbd> and <kbd>id_rsa.pub</kbd>. <kbd>id_rsa</kbd>
    is your private key: <em>don't share it with anyone!</em>.
    <kbd>id_rsa.pub</kbd> is your public key; upload it using the form
    below.</p> <h3>Prepare a Diff</h3> <p>The way you will submit code for this class is by using Git to create a
    patch using <kbd>git diff</kbd>. We will take your patch and apply it to
    a repository pegged to the commit that defines the start of the assignment.
    In this case, we've moved that commit several times as we're rolled out
    fixes, so it has probably diverged from what you tagged earlier. Assuming
    that your Git tree is up-to-date (<kbd>git pull</kbd> to be sure), here's
    what to do to generate the patch we are expecting below:</p> <pre class="code">
cse421@zion:~/src$ git diff 25742757..HEAD &gt; ASST1.patch</pre> <p>If the command complains then you probably don't have an up-to-date
    tree, so please <kbd>git pull</kbd> to come current.</p> <blockquote class="warning"> <p>Please <a href="../accounts/login?next=%252FASST%252F1">log in</a> so that you can submit your answers.
